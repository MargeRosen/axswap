# Ax Swap #

Buy, sell and swap your musical gear.

Musical instrument categories provide a convenient way to find the gear you want.

Registered members can post listings of musicial instruments, accessories and assorted gear for sale/swap.

Registration is easy and free!

Listings only appear on the site for one week after they're created, so you'll only see the most up-to-date info.


### Dev Collaborators' note: #If you git clone the repo don't forget to add your own application.yml file for development testing.

This is a working clone of GearSwap as we're adding features and had to change name from GearSwap to AxSwap.

### Open Issues #

1) email send/receive - RESOLVED - email confirmation is now working.

2) Signup/signin with Twitter. Should redirect to index, not sign in page.

3) Create categories link not visable. Work through test suite errors.  One bug is causing multiple failures.
